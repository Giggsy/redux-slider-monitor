Redux DevTools
=========================

A custom monitor for use with [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

It uses a slider based on [react-slider](https://github.com/mpowaga/react-slider) to slide between different recorded actions. It also features play/pause/step-through, which is inspired by some very cool [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) [examples](http://elm-lang.org/blog/time-travel-made-easy).
